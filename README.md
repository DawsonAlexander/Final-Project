# Final-Project
Introduction to Cybersecurity

Author: Dawson Alexander

This project is on the basic of cybersecurity and ways someone can protect themselves from hackers. These a big problems facing the world today as we become more and more dependent on technology. People need to know how to safely use technology from others who are using it for malicious purposes. It gives some basics like password protection, being wary of suspicious links and secure Wifi networks to name a few.

The target audience for this presentation would be everyday working people in an office setting or really anyone who uses a computer and phone often. There is more and more attacks happening on everyday people who don't even realize what they're doing when they're clicking on a link in an email or not having a strong password. People need to be more informed and more aware of what's cyber security protection is and how they can apply it. 

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It is crictcial in today's  world to ensure that our data is safe from malicious activity, that could affect our personal and professional lives.

Some basic cybersecurity practices include:

Keeping software up to date
Using strong passwords
Being cautious with email links and attachments
Securing Wi-Fi networks
Password Management

Why Passwords Matter

Passwords are often the first line of defense for your online accounts. Weak passwords or repeated use of the same password across multiple sites can make it easier for hackers to gain unauthorized access.

Best Practices for Passwords

Use Strong, Unique Passwords: A strong password should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Password Managers: Consider using a password manager to securely store your passwords. Password managers can generate random, complex passwords for each account and help you manage them easily.

Avoid Reusing Passwords: Never reuse the same password across multiple sites. If one account is compromised, others can be easily accessed.

Example: 
Using a Password Manager

Download a reputable password manager (LastPass or Bitwarden).
Use it to generate strong, random passwords for each of your accounts.
Enable two-factor authentication on the password manager for added security.

Two-Factor Authentication 
What is 2FA?
Two-factor authentication  adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring two methods of verification, It could be something you know (your password) and something you have (like a phone or security key).

How to Enable 2FA

Go to Account Settings: Visit the security or account settings page of the service.
Choose 2FA Method: Choose between methods like SMS, an authenticator app or a hardware security key.
Confirm Setup: Enter the code sent to your phone or app to finalize the setup.

Benefits of 2FA

Protects your account even if your password is compromised.
Adds a second layer of defense.

Safe Browsing Practices

Secure Websites: 
When browsing the internet, always look for the HTTPS protocol at the beginning of a website's URL. The "S" stands for secure, indicating that the site uses encryption to protect your data.

How to Identify Secure Websites:

Look for a padlock icon in the address bar.
Ensure the URL starts with https:// instead of just http://.

Avoid Phishing Scams

Phishing is when an attacker pretends to be a trustworthy entity to steal sensitive information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or texts.

Tips to Avoid Phishing:

Check the sender's email address for any irregularities.
Hover over links to see if the destination URL looks legitimate.
Never provide personal information in response to unsolicited requests.

What to Look For:

Suspicious Attachments or Links: Do not open attachments or click on links from unknown senders.
Urgency and Threats: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency.
Unusual Requests: Legitimate organizations will never ask for sensitive information via email.

Protecting Your Email Account

Use a strong password and 2FA.
Be mindful of email forwarding. Avoid auto-forwarding emails to untrusted third parties.

Using VPNs

What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic and makes it hard for people to hack you.

Why Use a VPN?
Protect Your Privacy: A VPN hides your IP address, making it more difficult for websites and hackers to track you.
Secure Public Wi-Fi: When using public Wi-Fi a VPN protects your data from potential interception.

How to Use a VPN
Choose a reputable VPN provider (ExpressVPN or NordVPN).
Download and install the VPN app on your device.
Connect to a server of your choice. Your internet connection will now be encrypted and routed through that server.

Conclusion

Cybersecurity is an essential part of our digital lives. By using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, practicing safe browsing, securing email, and using VPNs, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber threats.

Staying informed and proactive is key to protecting yourself online.
